The project files for a series of videos where I demonstrate the beauty of CSS.

This project was inspired by my love of CSS. There is something about the sublime beauty of taking a selection of plain ordinary text and transforming it into something exciting and large using nothing than a solid set of rules. I just am tickled by it and I love working with CSS so much that I wanted to demostrate that beauty via timelapse.

Despite this project being currently on hold while I continue my studies, I have plans for at least 10 episodes total.

Episode 1 is FINAL
Episode 2 is WIP
