        <p>Before his untimely death at age thirty-four Alexander L. Posey, Creek poet, humorist, and journalist, became nationally and internationally known for writing political satire in what became known as the Fus Fixico letters. Posey was the eldest of twelve children of Lewis H. Posey, of Scotch-Irish descent, and Nancy Phillips, a full-blood Creek and member of the prominent Harjo family. Born August 3, 1873, near present Eufaula, Creek Nation, young Alexander learned from his parents the importance of his Indian culture, religion, politics, and education. Before entering Indian University (now Bacone College), at age sixteen, he had a private tutor and attended public school. In 1896 he married Minnie Harris, a teacher. They had three children: Yahola Irving, Pachina Kipling, and Wynema Torrans. The children's names reflect Alexander Posey's literary interests (Irving referred to Washington Irving, Kipling to Rudyard Kipling, and Wynema to the heroine's name in Creek author Sophia Alice Callahan's novel).</p>

        <p>In 1895 Posey served as representative from Tuskegee in the House of Warriors. During the next several years he worked as superintendent of the Creek Asylum for Orphans at Okmulgee and as superintendent of public instruction for the Creek Nation. He served as interpreter for the Dawes Commission and as secretary at the Sequoyah Convention.</p>

        <p>Best known for his literary works, he started composing poetry during his college years. As an admirer of Henry David Thoreau, in his poems Posey reflects his love of nature. Published under the pen name Chinnubbee Harjo, the verses appeared in Twin Territories: The Indian Magazine and the Eufaula Indian Journal newspaper. Although he accepted the need for social change, by writing the Fus Fixico letters he expressed the concerns of Indians wanting to continue the traditional ways. Published in the Journal, the letters presented the dialogues of fictional characters, Fus Fixico and his full-blood Creek friends, who discussed land allotment, tribal termination, and impending statehood, which would end their way of life.</p>

        <p>Posey's journalistic career began in 1892 when he wrote for the Indian University Instructor and served as the Bacone reporter for the Eufaula Indian Journal. In 1902 he bought the paper and served as its editor until he sold it in 1904. As one of the first American Indians during the early twentieth century to own a newspaper, he gained national recognition as a journalist who used wit and humor to interest his readers.</p>

        <p>On May 27, 1908, Posey drowned as he and a friend crossed the raging floodwaters of the North Canadian River on their way from Eufaula to Muskogee. Posey was buried at Greenhill Cemetery in Muskogee. Since his death, readers of his poem "My Fancy" have noted an eerie similarity to the poet's own demise.</>

<pre>There is more glory in a drop of dew,
    That shineth only for an hour,
Than there is in the pomp of earth’s great Kings
    Within the noonday of their power.

There is more sweetness in a single strain
    That falleth from a wild bird’s throat,
At random in the lonely forest’s depths,
    Than there’s in all the songs that bards e’er wrote.

Yet men, for aye, rememb’ring Caesar’s name,
    Forget the glory in the dew,
And, praising Homer’s epic, let the lark’s
    Song fall unheeded from the blue.</pre>

<pre>Behold, the morning-glory’s sky-blue cup
Is mine wherewith to drink the nectar up
That morning spills of silver dew,
And song upon the winds that woo
And sigh their vows
Among the boughs!

Behold, I’m rich in diamonds rare,
And pearls, and breathe a golden air;
My room is filled with shattered beams
Of light; my life is one of dreams,
In my hut on
The hills of dawn.</pre>

<pre>        Some day this quest
        Shall cease;
           Some day,
           For aye,
     This heart shall rest
       In peace.
 Sometimes—ofttimes—I almost feel
 The calm upon my senses steal,
 So soft, and all but hear
 The dead leaves rustle near
 And sign to be
 At rest with me.
 Though I behold
   The ashen branches tossing to and fro,
   Somehow I only vaguely know
 The wind is rude and cold.</pre>

<pre>Between me and the noise of strife 
    Are walls of mountains set with pine;  
The dusty, care-strewn paths of life  
    Lead not to this retreat of mine.  
 
I hear the morning wind awake  
   Beyond the purple height,  
And, in the growing light,  
   The lap of lilies on the lake.  
 
I live with Echo and with Song,  
   And Beauty leads me forth to see  
Her temple’s colonnades, and long 
    Together do we love to be.  
 
The mountains wall me in, complete,  
   And leave me but a bit blue 
Above.    All year, the days are sweet— 
    How sweet! And all the long nights thro’  
 
I hear the river flowing by  
   Along its sandy bars;  
Behold, far in the midnight sky,  
    An infinite of stars!  
 
‘Tis sweet, when all is still,  
   When darkness gathers round,  
To hear, from hill to hill,  
   The far, the wandering sound.  
 
The cedar and the pine 
   Have pitched their tents with me.  
What freedom vast is mine!  
    What room! What mystery!  
 
Upon the dreamy southern breeze,  
    That steals in like a laden bee  
And sighs for rest among the trees,  
   Are far-blown bits of melody.  
 
What afterglows the twilight hold,  
    The darkening skies along!  
And O, what rose-like dawns unfold,  
    That smite the hills to song!  
 
High in the solitude of air,  
   The gray hawk circles on and on,  
Till, like a spirit soaring there,  
    His image pales and he is gone!</pre>

<pre>In the dreamy silence
Of the afternoon, a
Cloth of gold is woven
Over wood and prairie;
And the jaybird, newly
Fallen from the heaven,
Scatters cordial greetings,
And the air is filled with
Scarlet leaves, that, dropping,
Rise again, as ever,
With a useless sigh for
Rest—and it is Autumn.</pre>

    <br>
<pre>I’ve seen the beauty of the rose,
I’ve heard the music of the bird,
And given voice to my delight;
I’ve sought the shapes that come in dreams,
I’ve reached my hands in eager quest,
To fold them empty to my breast;
While you, the whole of all I’ve sought—
The love, the beauty, and the dreams—
Have stood, thro’ weal and woe, true at
My side, silent at my neglect.</pre>

<pre>Why do trees along the river
     Lean so far out o’er the tide?
Very wise men tell me why, but
    I am never satisfied;
And so I keep my fancy still,
    That trees lean out to save
The drowning from the clutches of
    The cold, remorseless wave.</pre>
